# My-machine-learning-templates
This is where I'll post my machine learning templates that I've created

these files are all in R (at this point), and can do an enormous amount of advanced work. They are very much works in progress, but nearly all of them generate higher accuracy than standard machine learning methods. This is where I'll continue to add and improve on the results these methods provide.
